      "problem": "Designers were spending hours refreshing the photos filled in by Sketch content generator plugins or clicking through Google image search results and other UI sites to find images that represent real sets of users. Real sets of users, in this perspective, are diverse sets of users - ones from varying age, racial, and gender groups.<br><br>We see that in the real world. We expect that of our users. Yet, somehow, all the sources for filling in content only want to supply us with 25–35 year old white dudes - which is great if you're in the game of creating products exclusively for 25–35 year old white dudes, but if you're not, it's really really bad.",

It was essentially a table view of actions that had occurred alongside a timestamp and brief description of what happened.<br><br>I was tasked with creating a page where users can see what's happening with a work item as well as what's been happening with all the work in their queue.",
      "constraints": "<b>Technical:</b> There were many technical restraints in working with a legacy system, particularly in what interactions could and could not happen.<br><b>Privacy:</b> My ability to see the current product state and see how it was naturally used was hindered by corporate privacy policies.",
      "research": "The client was remote, and due to corporate privacy policies, screen sharing wasn't allowed - so I worked with an internal PM and UX team to understand current use patterns and problems. In the initial ideation phase, I worked to synthesize their data and insights into actionable product features.",
      "design": "The initial proposal/idea focused on having an activity view after clicking an item in the table, in initial ideation we realized pulling out the activity feed as a standalone page would provide the most value to users.",
      "designImg1": "img/fidelityxtracidea.png",
      "designCaption1": "This is a low fidelity version of the vision we decided to pursue after an initial period of exploration and ideation. I kept a lefthand menu to match style patterns in other aspects of the product and we included the ability to view activity for a specific list or queue, the ability to sort activity by most recent or by work item, and the ability to sort by activity type. I placed visual emphasis on the action taken and the work item it was taken upon and added in a quick reply button to enable users to quickly take an action in response. We turned this into a clickable prototype and sent it out to users to get feedback.",
      "designImg2": "img/fidelityxtracv1.png",
      "designCaption2": "From the previous prototype, we got a lot of great feedback that we implemented going towards a more high fidelity design. The menu iconography wasn't clear so we switched to plain text labels. Some users were confused by the positioning of the filter options, so I created a different visual hierarchy to try to provide greater separation between items that dictated what the list was and the list itself. I also learned that being able to hide certain fields could greatly improve efficiency of some users, so I included a settings option. I then sent a new prototype out into the world.",
      "designImg3": "img/fidelityxtracfinal.png",
      "designCaption3": "A few key findings from the prior prototype and newfound technical freedoms evolved the design to it's current (final) form. The ability to do a quick search to find a specific item from the feed had been thought about in the beginning but was initially unfeasible. I discovered that internal engineering teams had almost completed building this as a new feature, and since our user interviews had indicated that it would provide high value, I included it in this version. With this newfound ability, having search, list options, and display settings living in different spots made the use of these features complicated and led to an incohesive experience - so I moved them to a central location as a secondary menu. I learned that the type of action taken was most indicative of whether or not a user needed to respond, so I increased the visual prominence of the action icon. I also discovered that having the response actions so far away from the action taken was slowing users down, so I moved it right below the items.",

      "designCaption4": "A key piece of this redesign in the ability to quickly respond with a form that appears inline with the prior action.

Sounds a little stressful, but you know your handy dashboard has your back until - wait, this dashboard doesn't have your back at all! You stare, slack jawed staring at a listing of nothing but project names, paralyzed by the realization that you have to click into and scroll through each and every one to find out what's happening. The part of your workflow that should only take 30 minutes actually eats into hours of your day.<br><br><b>Problem Two - The Cluttered Description Page:</b><br>You're a developer trying to find the key links for the project you just started. You know they're included somewhere in the project page, but for the life of you - you can't remember where.

As Gigster scales, the timeline for a project to be completely handed off/deactivated can be much longer than the actual end date. Because of this, an individual user's dashboard can be filled with more projects than the max project estimate in the original designs - reducing the intended simplicity.",

Often, at events or in meetings, he would find himself struggling to remember key details about a company, but he could always remember some key filter. In these moments, he didn't have his laptop to search through the database of his investments, and even if he did - it wouldn't be much help. The antiquated system all the data was stored in made it difficult to quickly visualize and skim through companies based on things like company type, the fund invested through, or the founder's name. He needed to have his investments in his pocket in an easy to browse interface.",
      "constraints": "<b>Short timeline:</b> 1 month for complete cycle of ideation, design, and beta build.<br><b>Data and Formats:</b> The data I could display, and how it could be pulled from the database, had limited to no flexibility based on the services the customer used.",
