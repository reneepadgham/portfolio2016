To me, this is one of the most valuable parts of my design process. I like to envision a day in the life of my user and feel their pain points. I create personas that allow me to understand the different types of experiences that might bring a user to my product.</p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 item"><div class="header"><img src="img/research.png"><h2>Research</h2></div><p>I use resources such as customer support, sales teams, and user interviews to help build out my understanding of the user. If the client has been tracking any quantitative data, I also invite it to the party. This gets my bachelor’s in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Mathematics really excited.</p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 item"><div class="header"><img src="img/brainstorm.png"><h2>Brainstorm/Prototype</h2></div><p>I then invite my oldest friends, Pencil and Paper, over. We have a tea party (Earl Grey ftw), and after a few rounds, we get the basics together in a flow that can be shown to users and internal teams for feedback. I often invite Invision, one of Invision’s close relatives, or HTML/CSS into the mix depending on the vibe.</p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 item"><div class="header"><img src="img/polish.png"><h2>Polish</h2></div><p>Before I take my work out, I normally dress it up with my new friend Sketch - but sometimes I reach out to my old friends Illustrator and Photoshop. I also like to bring my design to life using html, css, and javascript.</p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 item"><div class="header"><img src="img/test.png"><h2>Test</h2></div><p>During this time, I like to dress it up in a few different options and get user feedback. This process, called A/B testing, helps me figure out which version solves my user’s problems the best.</p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-0 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 item"><div class="header"><img src="img/ship.png"><h2>Ship</h2></div><p>With that information, I polish it up and help my team ship it off.</p></div></div></div></div>
