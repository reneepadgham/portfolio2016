<div class="desk-wrapper wrapper container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-5 header-img"><img src="/img/desk.png"></div><div class="intro-text col-md-7"><h1>This is my desk.</h1><p>There are many like it, but this one is mine. It’s pretty minimal, but it gets the job done.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-12 design-process"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/hat.png"><h3>Empathize</h3><p>When I come to my desk for a new project, I start by putting on my empathy hat. To me, this is one of the most valuable parts of my design process. I like to envision a day in the life of my user and feel their pain points. I create personas that allow me to understand the different types of experiences that might bring a user to my product.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/postit.png"><h3>Research</h3><p>I use resources such as customer support, sales teams, and user interviews to help build out my understanding of the user. If the client has been tracking any quantitative data, I also invite it to the party. This gets my bachelor’s in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Mathematics really excited.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/tea.png"><h3>Brainstorm/Prototype</h3><p>I then invite my oldest friends, Pencil and Paper, over. We have a tea party (Earl Grey ftw), and after a few rounds, we get the basics together in a flow that can be shown to users and internal teams for feedback. I often invite Invision, one of Invision’s close relatives, or HTML/CSS into the mix depending on the vibe.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/tools.png"><h3>Polish</h3><p>Before I take my work out, I normally dress it up with my new friend Sketch - but sometimes I reach out to my old friends Illustrator and Photoshop. I also like to bring my design to life using html, css, and javascript.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/laptop.png"><h3>Test</h3><p>During this time, I like to dress it up in a few different options and get user feedback. This process, called A/B testing, helps me figure out which version solves my user’s problems the best.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/rocket.png"><h3>Ship</h3><p>With that information, I polish it up and help my team ship it off.</p></div></div></div></div>
