<div class="desk-wrapper wrapper"><h1>Design Process</h1><div class="divider"></div><p>I like people. If you're here to figure out who I am as a designer, that sentence is key. I like people - the ways they think, the places they can be, the clothes they wear, the millions of different days, and problems, they're having at this exact moment.<br><br>As a designer - I spend my time figuring out how to make those days, and those problems, better. If I didn't like people, I wouldn't be any good at that. Here's an overview of how I use that in practice. If you didn't already guess it - I have strong feels about human centered design and user data.</p><div class="design-process"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><div class="item"><h2><img src="img/empathy.png"> Empathize</h2><div class="divider thin"></div><p>I spend a lot of time thinking about and understanding my user - through user models and observation. While asking too many questions got me in trouble in kindergarten, here it helps re-enforce my understanding of the problem and context. I keep at the question game until I also understand the constraints and goals of the business/product.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="item"><h2><img src="img/ideate.png"> Ideate</h2><div class="divider thin"></div><p>Once I have the problem, scope, context, and constraints down - I begin creating the possible set of solutions. The best of these will be at the intersection of usability, feasibility, and viability. By the end, I have a lot of notes and a set of low fidelity sketches to carry me forward.</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><div class="item"><h2><img src="img/create.png"> Create</h2><div class="divider thin"></div><p>I begin creating versions with heart. Using my notes and initial sketches, I go to my computer and create fleshed out (but not fully refined) versions of the solutions. Using prototyping software or code, I give the product it's first life.</p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="item"><h2><img src="img/iterate.png"> Iterate</h2><div class="divider thin"></div><p>I send my ideas into the wild to see what they discover. This process involves allowing users to interact with one version, or multiple versions, of the product and seeing how it performs. This is ideally a loop, in which feedback generates new versions and opportunities for discovery until we have it right.</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><div class="item"><h2><img src="img/ship.png"> Ship</h2><div class="divider thin"></div><p>I refine my solution to it's most polished version and send it out into the real world once and for all. I enjoy working with development during this phase to make sure everything integrates seamlessly.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="tools-wrapper wrapper"><div class="row"><h1>Tools</h1><div class="divider"></div><p><i>"It's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools."</i><br>Still, these power up my work flow.
