That’s more than an aesthetic - I’ve spent the past year and a half traveling 16 countries (which doesn’t leave much room for possessions). <img src="img/bookshelf.png"> Outside of being jet-lagged, I enjoy teaching design and computer science to high schoolers through <a href="http://hacker.fund/" target="_blank">Hacker Fund</a>, taking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reneepadgham" target="_blank">pictures</a> of all the places I go, reading, and <a href="https://www.medium.com/@reneepadgham" target="_blank">writing</a>. I organize dancing and women in tech communities (message me if you want to join!). If I’m lost, you can probably find me at the closest tea room or taqueria. I prefer high fives to handshakes, but hugs trump both.<br><img src="img/designthinking.png"> I stumbled into design in 4th grade when I realized I could draw on a computer. Since then, I've added in a love for technology, understanding others, and software development, along with a degree in quantitative methods in economics in mathematics - which makes me a <s>jack of all trades</s> <b>product designer.</b><br><img src="img/communication.png"> <a ui-sref="contact">Please say hello</a> - I’d love to know which taqueria makes the <b>best</b> mission style burrito, your favorite book, or your thoughts on my site!</p></div></div></div></div>
