I organize dancing and women in tech communities (message me if you want to join!). If I’m lost, you can probably find me at the closest tea room or taqueria. I prefer high fives to handshakes, but hugs trump both.<br><br>I stumbled into design in 4th grade when I realized I could draw on a computer. Since then, I've added in a love for technology, understanding others, and software development, along with a degree in quantitative methods in economics in mathematics - which makes me a <s>jack of all trades</s> <b>product designer.</b></p></div></div></div></div>
