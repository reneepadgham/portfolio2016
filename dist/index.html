          When I come to my desk for a new project, I start by putting on my empathy hat. To me, this is one of the most valuable parts of my design process. I like to envision a day in the life of my user and feel their pain points. I create personas that allow
          me to understand the different types of experiences that might bring a user to my product.

        <h3>Research</h3>

          I use resources such as customer support, sales teams, and user interviews to help build out my understanding of the user. If the client has been tracking any quantitative data, I also invite it to the party. This gets my bachelorâ€™s in Quantitative Methods
          in Economics and Mathematics really excited.

        <h3>Brainstorm/Prototype</h3>

          I then invite my oldest friends, Pencil and Paper, over. We have a tea party (Earl Grey ftw), and after a few rounds, we get the basics together in a flow that can be shown to users and internal teams for feedback. I often invite Invision, one of Invisionâ€™s
          close relatives, or HTML/CSS into the mix depending on the vibe.

        <p>
          Outside of being jet-lagged,
          I enjoy teaching design and computer science to high schoolers through <a href="http://hacker.fund/" target="_blank">Hacker Fund</a>, taking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reneepadgham" target="_blank">pictures</a> of all the places
          I go, reading, and <a href="https://www.medium.com/@reneepadgham" target="_blank">writing</a>. I organize dancing and women in tech communities (message me if you want to join!). If Iâ€™m lost, you can probably find me at the closest tea room
          or taqueria. I prefer high fives to handshakes, but hugs trump both.
          <br><br />
          I stumbled into design in 4th grade when I realized I could draw on a computer. Since then, I've added in a love for technology, understanding others, and software development, along with a degree in quantitative methods in economics in mathematics
          - which makes me a <s>jack of all trades</s> <b>product designer.</b>

Sounds a little stressful, but you know your handy dashboard has your back untilâ€¦ wait, this dashboard doesnâ€™t have your back at all! You stare, slack jawed staring at a listing of nothing but project names, paralyzed by the realization that you have to click into and scroll through each and every one to find out whatâ€™s happening. The part of your workflow that should only take 30 minutes actually eats into hours of your day.<br><br><b>Problem Two - The Cluttered Description Page:</b><br>Youâ€™re a developer trying to find the key links for the project you just started. You know theyâ€™re included somewhere in the project page, but for the life of you - you canâ€™t remember where. After a lot of clicking, squinting, and scrolling around, you finally stumble upon them - but wait, where were those filesâ€¦",

I worked with him to find out the largest problems up to this point and what the product needed to be able to do going forward.

They have potential states of good (green), be careful (orange), and this is going south quickly (red) to notify users when action is necessary.

      "retrospective": "In retrospect (and going forward!), Iâ€™m aware of some weaknesses in the current design. As Gigster scales, the timeline for a project to be completely handed off/deactivated can be much longer than the actual end date. Because of this, an individual userâ€™s dashboard can be filled with more projects than the max project estimate in the original designs - reducing the intended simplicity.",

      "problem": "<b>It was difficult to filter, recall, and find important details for portfolio investments.</b><br><br>Tim Draper, of Draper Associates, has been investing in companies for a long time. Often, at events or in meetings, he would find himself struggling to remember key details about a company, but he could always remember some key filter. In these moments, he didnâ€™t have his laptop to search through the database of his investments, and even if he did - it wouldnâ€™t be much help. The antiquated system all the data was stored in made it difficult to quickly visualize and skim through companies based on things like company type, the fund invested through, or the founderâ€™s name. He needed to have his investments in his pocket in an easy to browse interface.",
      "research": "I worked with Tim to find out how he would use the existing system and the key information he usually needed. In addition, I spoke to his assistant and key staff members who would also be using the application to find out their issues, and any requests they commonly received from Tim for information.<br><br>Originally, Tim wanted a swipable card interface, but I had usability concerns. We tested a few layouts and came to the conclusion that the card layout in combination with more sorted grid options covered all expected use cases.",
      "constraints": "<b>Short timeline:</b> 1 month for complete cycle of ideation, design, and beta build.<br><b>Data and Formats:</b> The data I could display, and how it could be pulled from the database, had limited to no flexibility based on the services the customer used.",
      "design": "We decided to make a no frills interface - clean, simple, and easily readable. There were two primary use cases we designed for: 1.) the ability to swipe through all investments in a card-like interface, and 2.) the ability to quickly skim through companies by category or fund.",
