  <h1>Hi, I'm Renee.</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>
  I'm a San Francisco based product designer. For the past year and a half, I've been working at <a href="https://gigster.com" target="_blank">Gigster</a> designing internal tools and bringing design to their world class development service. I was the first, but now we have an amazing community of 100+ designers! Before that, I worked at <a href="http://www.draper.vc/" target="_blank">Draper Associates</a> on special projects like an internal portfolio management tool.
<br /><br />
When I'm not partying with pixels, I challenge my ability to empathize by placing <a href="https://medium.com/ways-to-feel-human/i-m-traveling-the-world-collecting-feelings-bc97a363b523#.7u7x1d55k" target="_blank">poems about other people's feelings</a> on stickers around the world - I am the jet-lag master. I also write about other things like <a href="https://medium.com/human-x-creator" target="_blank">artists</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/we-should-all-be-weird-as-fuck-c751cf31d765#.ynsvvipmk" target="_blank">being weird</a>, and I edit a <a href="https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons" target="_blank">women in tech publication</a>. I teach design and development at hackathons around the US through <a href="http://hacker.fund" target="_blank">Hacker Fund</a>. Sometimes, I even remember to let my friends and family know I'm alive by posting pictures on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reneepadgham/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (not often enough).
<br /><br />
    I'm always looking for my next adventure and opportunity to learn - if you want the details, check out my resume  <a href="http://reneepadgham.com/reneepadgham-resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> or
    say hello, <a href="mailto:renee@padgham.com?Subject=Hello%20there!" target="_top">renee@padgham.com</a>! :)

<p>This is like adult show and tell - except I can't always show my shiniest new toys. Like many others before me, and many after to come, I have the NDA disease. I'm in recovery, but if you don't see a project type you're looking for - <a href="mailto:renee@padgham.com?Subject=Work%20example%20request" target="_top">ask me about it.</a> There's a good chance I've got something up my sleeve.</p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      I like people. If you're here to figure out who I am as a designer, that sentence is key. I like people - the ways they think, the places they can be, the clothes they wear, the millions of different days, and problems, they're having at this exact moment.
               <br /><br />
               As a designer - I spend my time figuring out how to make those days, and those problems, better. If I didn't like people, I wouldn't be any good at that.
               Here's an overview of how I use that in practice. If you didn't already guess it - I have strong feels about human centered design and user data.
    </p>
    <div class="design-process">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="item">
            <h2><img src="img/empathy.png"> Empathize</h2>
            <div class="divider thin"></div>
            <p>I spend a lot of time thinking about and understanding my user - through user models and observation. While asking too many questions got me in trouble in kindergarten, here it helps re-enforce my understanding of the problem and context. I keep at the question game until I also understand the constraints and
              goals of the business/product.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="item">
            <h2><img src="img/ideate.png"> Ideate</h2>
            <div class="divider thin"></div>
            <p>Once I have the problem, scope, context, and constraints down - I begin creating the possible set of solutions. The best of these will be at the intersection of usability, feasibility, and viability. By the end, I have a lot of notes and a
              set of low fidelity sketches to carry me forward. </p>

            <h2><img src="img/create.png"> Create</h2>
            <div class="divider thin"></div>
            <p>I begin creating versions with heart. Using my notes and initial sketches, I go to my computer and create fleshed out (but not fully refined) versions of the solutions. Using prototyping software or code, I give the product it's first life.</p>
          </div>

            <h2><img src="img/iterate.png"> Iterate</h2>
            <div class="divider thin"></div>
            <p>I send my ideas into the wild to see what they discover. This process involves allowing users to interact with one version, or multiple versions, of the product and seeing how it performs. This is ideally a loop, in which feedback generates
              new versions and opportunities for discovery until we have it right.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">

            <h2><img src="img/ship.png"> Ship</h2>
            <div class="divider thin"></div>
            <p>I refine my solution to it's most polished version and send it out into the real world once and for all. I enjoy working with development during this phase to make sure everything integrates seamlessly.</p>

Sounds a little stressful, but you know your handy dashboard has your back until… wait, this dashboard doesn't have your back at all! You stare, slack jawed staring at a listing of nothing but project names, paralyzed by the realization that you have to click into and scroll through each and every one to find out what's happening.
