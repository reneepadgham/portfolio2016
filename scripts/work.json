      "problem": "Designers were spending hours refreshing the photos filled in by Sketch content generator plugins or clicking through Google image search results and other UI sites to find images that represent real sets of users. Real sets of users, in this perspective, are diverse sets of users — ones from varying age, racial, and gender groups.<br><br>We see that in the real world. We expect that of our users. Yet, somehow, all the sources for filling in content only want to supply us with 25–35 year old white dudes — which is great if you’re in the game of creating products exclusively for 25–35 year old white dudes, but if you’re not, it’s really really bad.",

      "design": "User experience, especially when used in combination with Craft for Sketch, was highly prioritized.

      "retrospective": "The product was released on September 7th and since then has received some amazing feedback. This has so far resulted in: more clarity in permissions given, an amended terms of service, and an in-site faq page. Future additions will include more filtering options and potentially a Sketch plugin.",

      "problem": "<b>It was difficult to visualize and find important information.</b> <br><br><b>Problem One - The Unhelpful Dashboard:</b><br>You're a project manager for many projects, in multiple locations, working with teams in different time zones - and your main window into the state of all of them is a dashboard page on your screen. Sounds a little stressful, but you know your handy dashboard has your back until - wait, this dashboard doesn't have your back at all! You stare, slack jawed staring at a listing of nothing but project names, paralyzed by the realization that you have to click into and scroll through each and every one to find out what's happening. The part of your workflow that should only take 30 minutes actually eats into hours of your day.<br><br><b>Problem Two - The Cluttered Description Page:</b><br>You're a developer trying to find the key links for the project you just started. You know they're included somewhere in the project page, but for the life of you - you can't remember where. After a lot of clicking, squinting, and scrolling around, you finally stumble upon them - but wait, where were those files…",
      "research": "At this point, the platform was still fairly early stage and the individual most connected with users was the CTO. I worked with him to find out the largest problems up to this point and what the product needed to be able to do going forward. Since I was part of the network, I was also available to collect qualitative information and do user testing with project managers and developers on the platform.",

      "constraints": "<b>Short timeline:</b> < 1 month for complete cycle of ideation, design, and production implementation.<br><b>Layout:</b> Some aspects of the original layout needed to be maintained for engineering/timeline purposes.",
      "design": "I created a visual interface using a progress bar for timeliness and an emoticon face for customer satisfaction. They have potential states of good (green), be careful (orange), and this is going south quickly (red) to notify users when action is necessary. We also modularized the gig details page, locking key info to the top for easy access.",

      "designCaption2": "The modularized dashboard is easier to navigate and find key information regularly.",
      "retrospective": "In retrospect (and going forward!), I'm aware of some weaknesses in the current design. As Gigster scales, the timeline for a project to be completely handed off/deactivated can be much longer than the actual end date. Because of this, an individual user's dashboard can be filled with more projects than the max project estimate in the original designs - reducing the intended simplicity.",

      "problem": "<b>It was difficult to filter, recall, and find important details for portfolio investments.</b><br><br>Tim Draper, of Draper Associates, has been investing in companies for a long time. Often, at events or in meetings, he would find himself struggling to remember key details about a company, but he could always remember some key filter. In these moments, he didn't have his laptop to search through the database of his investments, and even if he did - it wouldn't be much help. The antiquated system all the data was stored in made it difficult to quickly visualize and skim through companies based on things like company type, the fund invested through, or the founder's name. He needed to have his investments in his pocket in an easy to browse interface.",
      "research": "I worked with Tim to find out how he would use the existing system and the key information he usually needed. In addition, I spoke to his assistant and key staff members who would also be using the application to find out their issues, and any requests they commonly received from Tim for information.<br><br>Originally, Tim wanted a swipable card interface, but I had usability concerns. We tested a few layouts and came to the conclusion that the card layout in combination with more sorted grid options covered all expected use cases.",
      "constraints": "<b>Short timeline:</b> 1 month for complete cycle of ideation, design, and beta build.<br><b>Data and Formats:</b> The data I could display, and how it could be pulled from the database, had limited to no flexibility based on the services the customer used.",
      "design": "We decided to make a no frills interface - clean, simple, and easily readable. There were two primary use cases we designed for: 1.) the ability to swipe through all investments in a card-like interface, and 2.) the ability to quickly skim through companies by category or fund.",

The primary mechanism is a deck of cards containing other professionals in your network.
