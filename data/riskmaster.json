  "responsibility": "I led design and development (objective-c) on an app that organizes and manages information on portfolio investments.",
  "tagline": "A visual portfolio management tool.",
  "problem": "<b>It was difficult to filter, recall, and find important details for portfolio investments.</b><br><br>Tim Draper, of Draper Associates, has been investing in companies for a long time. Often, at events or in meetings, he would find himself struggling to remember key details about a company, but he could always remember some key filter. In these moments, he didn’t have his laptop to search through the database of his investments, and even if he did - it wouldn’t be much help. The antiquated system all the data was stored in made it difficult to quickly visualize and skim through companies based on things like company type, the fund invested through, or the founder’s name. He needed to have his investments in his pocket in an easy to browse interface.",
  "research": "I worked with Tim to find out how he would use the existing system and the key information he usually needed. In addition, I spoke to his assistant and key staff members who would also be using the application to find out their issues, and any requests they commonly received from Tim for information.<br><br>Originally, Tim wanted a swipable card interface, but I had usability concerns. We tested a few layouts and came to the conclusion that the card layout in combination with more sorted grid options covered all expected use cases.",
  "constraints": "<b>Short timeline:</b> 1 month for complete cycle of ideation, design, and beta build.<br><b>Data and Formats:</b> The data I could display, and how it could be pulled from the database, had limited to no flexibility based on the services the customer used.",
  "design": "We decided to make a no frills interface - clean, simple, and easily readable. There were two primary use cases we designed for: 1.) the ability to swipe through all investments in a card-like interface, and 2.) the ability to quickly skim through companies by category or fund.",
  "designImg1": "img/riskmaster-homegrid.png",
  "designCaption1": "The home screen - clicking view all takes the user to the card inteface, the square buttons direct to filtered grid layouts.",
  "designImg2": "img/riskmaster-cardview.png",
  "designCaption2": "The front view of a card.",
  "designImg3": "img/riskmaster-detailview.png",
  "designCaption3": "The back side of a card, accessed by tapping on either a card or logo in grid view. Easily dismissed by swiping down.",
  "designImg4": "img/riskmaster-gridview.png",
  "designCaption4": "The filtered grid view.",
  "retrospective": "Having social information for the founder and multi-tier filtering would provide an even better solution to the problem. These were left out in the original development cycle due to time/data constraints."
