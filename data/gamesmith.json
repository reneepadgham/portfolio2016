  "responsibility": "I led product design.",
  "tagline": "The network for video game professionals.",
  "problem": "<b>There isnâ€™t a site for video game professionals to showcase their work and find jobs.</b>",
  "research": "The CEO is actively involved in the video game space and had done extensive user interviews before coming to me with the project - most project decisions were based on that data.",
  "constraints": "<b>Timeline:</b> 3 weeks for design.",
  "design": "We wanted to combine the clean feel of a networking site with the modern playfulness of a game. The primary mechanism is a deck of cards containing other professionals in your network. Each user has a card which lists their accomplishments, and users can validate or invalidate other user's accomplishments. I created a color palette based on video game imagery, and I combined clean typography with modern iconography to give the content heavy product a lighter feel.",
  "retrospective": "The deck nature of the layout works well in early stages, but alternate layouts that allow the same playful feel are being explored as the product scales."
